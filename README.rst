My ~/.vim/
===========================

This is the vim config (``~/.vim/``) I use. It is constantly changing, and probably full of
bugs. I have never tested it on windows, but I use it daily on Ubuntu and OSX
both the terminal version (vim) and the gui (gvim/macvim).


Python plugins
--------------

Some of the plugins are made by me. These are probably the most unstable of all
the plugins, but they should be good examples for those who want to get started
making python plugins for vim. A good starting point is ``:help python`` followed by
a look in ``plugins/link.vim``.
